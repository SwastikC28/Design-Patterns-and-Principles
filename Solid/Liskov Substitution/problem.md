### Problem Statement:

Design a software system for managing different types of shapes, such as circles, rectangles, and triangles. The system should allow users to calculate the area and perimeter of each shape, and also be able to compare shapes based on their area. Implement the system adhering to the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), ensuring that any subtype of shape can be substituted for its base type without altering the correctness of the program.
