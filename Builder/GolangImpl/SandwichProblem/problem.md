## Problem Statement

You are tasked with designing a system for creating customized sandwiches in a sandwich shop application. Each sandwich can have various ingredients such as bread type, meat, cheese, vegetables, sauces, etc. Customers should be able to order sandwiches with specific ingredients and options.

Design a solution using the Builder Pattern to construct different types of sandwiches with flexible customization options. Your solution should allow easy addition and modification of sandwich ingredients and options without modifying the base sandwich creation logic.

This problem will help you practice structuring a complex object creation process using the Builder Pattern in a real-world scenario.
